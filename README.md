# Résumé

Here are the LaTeX files for my résumé.

For this iteration, I didn't use a template—I just designed everything from the ground up. (Not that there's all that much actual design involved!) I think the GitHub icon is cute :).

If you like parts of the design, feel free to use them yourself. I've released everything under a BSD licence. The main file is `resume.ltx`; it includes and compiles all the relevant sections. Some of the unused section files are not up to date.

The actual résumé breaks a bunch of rules people give you for writing résumés. Meh. The biggest problem is that it takes two pages rather than one: I should go through and remove a bunch of detail from each of the experience bullet points, but I really don't feel like it.

I'll probably create a more compact version at some point.
